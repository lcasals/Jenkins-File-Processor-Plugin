# Jenkins-Document-Data-Validator
Document Data Validator is a Jenkins plugin that extracts metadata from PDF, Word, and text files, validates the content, and saves metadata into a JSON file. It detects and lists files in a directory, prints out file information, and (will eventually) report errors such as spelling mistakes and broken links to the console. The plugin is designed to fail the Jenkins pipeline if any errors are detected

## Features:  
- Extracts metadata from PDF, Word, and text files
- Validates content for spelling errors and broken links
- Detects and lists files in a directory
- Saves metadata and errors in a JSON file
- Fails the Jenkins pipeline if any errors are detected

## Usage: 
To use the Document Data Validator plugin in your Jenkins pipeline, add the following step to your `Jenkinsfile`:

```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Validation') {
            steps {
                script {
                    validateDocuments(directory: 'C:\path\to\inputFolder\', outputDirectory: 'C:\path\to\output')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
Replace "C:\path\to\inputFolder\" with the path to the directory containing the documents you want to validate.
make sure to include the backslash at the end
